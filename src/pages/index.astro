   <h2 class="whitesmoke-text">About Me</h2>
  <p class="whitesmoke-text"> I have only been coding for a few months now but I decided to take AP computer sciecnce to learn this really improtant life skill. To me coding is very important to learn because it is a big part of our world, and will be even larger in the future. I hope all my projects show what I have learned!</p>
